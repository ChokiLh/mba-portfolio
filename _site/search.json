    "text": "About\nI am MBA candidate in University Canada West with an international exposure in the fields of education, media, and community relations. My stay and job in Bhutan, Thailand, and Canada have gifted me a global perspective on leadership, collaboration, and problem-solving. The different cultures I interacted with in my academic and professional life have developed my flexibility, communication, and organization skills which in turn made me able to perform well in multi-cultural and interdisciplinary settings.\nI plan to use the knowledge and skills gained from my MBA studies to become an expert in strategic and analytical thinking so that I could better see how data-driven insights and inclusive management practices can together enhance operational efficiency. Besides, I would like to focus on the avenues through which innovation and ethical leadership can create sustainable values for both organizations and their communities.\nI want to put my learning process into practice to create fair systems that equips people, unite them in a better way, and eventually lead to an impact that is both social and organizational but is also meaningful."
